### Instructions:
1. Analyze the user's prompt to determine what data they are requesting.
2. Use the table schemas above to understand the relationships between tables, especially foreign keys.
3. Only output a valid SQL SELECT query (no explanations or extra text).
4. Use JOINs where appropriate (not everywhere) to connect tables using foreign key relationships.
5. Alias tables if needed for clarity.
6. Include only relevant columns based on the user prompt.
